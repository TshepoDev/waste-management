## Accessing Swagger API Docs

After starting the application, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) to access Swagger UI.

The Swagger UI will display a list of all available API endpoints, along with descriptions and request/response formats.

You can interactively test the endpoints by providing parameters and executing the requests directly from the Swagger interface.
